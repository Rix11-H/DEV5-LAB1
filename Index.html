        <h1>My feelings towards <span>Development 5</span></h1>
        <p>
            At first, I did not sign up for the course because of the fact that I already finished the masterclass <i>Development Advanced</i>
            at the end of last year. <br>
            Eventually I decided to walk this path once more and see what's different. 
        </p>
        <p>I'm mostly excited about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the opportunity to practice known skills some more (vue.js, node.js)</li>
            <li>more 3D development insights (three.js) and the assignement for Donutello's</li>
            <li>interesting new technologies like Web3, blockchain,...</li>
        </ul>
        <span>Please challenge me kindly :P</span>
